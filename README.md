Problem 1: The Race Around the World

This is a basic web app with a time display and a history table for tracking start-stop indications. 
When the app is reloaded, any stored entries from the history table will be reloaded from last usage, 
but the time display will be reset to 0. 

Thank you for the interesting chance to foray into the realm of web development. It was strange knowing that
some functions would not work across many browsers, and many other eccentricies I had come across.

Best,
Jason Lee
